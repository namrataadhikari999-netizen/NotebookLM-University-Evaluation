### Prompt 1:

Compare and contrast the responsibilities of the Cloud Broker and the Cloud Auditor across the NIST publication and the Cloud Reference Model and Evolution.pdf. Use bullet points.



### Response: 

The responsibilities of the Cloud Broker and the Cloud Auditor are clearly defined as two of the five major actors in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cloud Computing Reference Architecture. Although both act as intermediaries or external entities within the cloud ecosystem, their core functions are distinct.



\### Cloud Broker Responsibilities



The Cloud Broker (CB) is an entity that focuses on \*\*managing, enhancing, and negotiating\*\* cloud service delivery and usage between Cloud Providers and Cloud Consumers.



\*   \*\*Management and Negotiation:\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   Manages the use, performance, and delivery of cloud services.

&nbsp;   \*   Negotiates relationships and contracts between Cloud Providers and Cloud Consumers.

&nbsp;   \*   Acts as an intermediary, which a Cloud Consumer may request service from instead of contacting the Cloud Provider directly.

&nbsp;   \*   Helps consumers manage the complexity of service offerings.

&nbsp;   \*   Offers a single point of access for controlling numerous cloud services.

&nbsp;   \*   Provides a single consistent interface to multiple different providers for technical or commercial objectives.



\*   \*\*Service Enhancement and Creation (The Three Categories):\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   \*\*Service Intermediation:\*\* The broker enhances a specific capability of a given service, providing \*\*value-added services\*\* to Cloud Consumers. This enhancement may include performance reporting, improved security, or identity management.

&nbsp;   \*   \*\*Service Aggregation:\*\* The broker \*\*combines and integrates multiple services\*\* into one or more new services. This involves ensuring data and service integration, as well as secure data transfer between the consumer and multiple providers.

&nbsp;   \*   \*\*Service Arbitrage:\*\* Similar to aggregation, but the services being integrated or aggregated are not fixed, allowing the broker the \*\*flexibility to choose services from various providers\*\*.



\### Cloud Auditor Responsibilities



The Cloud Auditor (CA) is an entity that performs \*\*independent assessments and verification\*\* of cloud operations, controls, and compliance.



\*   \*\*Independent Assessment:\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   Conducts an \*\*independent examination/assessment\*\* of cloud service controls, information system operations, performance, and the security of the cloud implementation.

&nbsp;   \*   Provides a valuable, inherent function for the government by conducting independent performance and security monitoring of cloud services.

&nbsp;   \*   The audit may involve interactions with both the Cloud Consumer and the Cloud Provider.

&nbsp;   \*   Audits are performed to \*\*verify conformance to standards\*\* through the review of objective evidence.



\*   \*\*Audit Types (Taxonomy Components):\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   \*\*Security Audit:\*\* Systematically evaluates the cloud system by measuring how well it conforms to a set of established security criteria. This involves assessing the system’s security controls (management, operational, and technical safeguards) to ensure they are implemented correctly and are producing the desired security outcomes.

&nbsp;   \*   \*\*Privacy-Impact Audit:\*\* Systematically evaluates the cloud system by measuring its conformance to established privacy-impact criteria. This helps ensure compliance with privacy laws and regulations governing personal information (PI) and personally identifiable information (PII).

&nbsp;   \*   \*\*Performance Audit:\*\* Systematically evaluates the cloud system by measuring how well it conforms to established performance criteria, including verification of Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance.

&nbsp;   \*   Verifies compliance with law and security policy (e.g., data retention policies).

\### Comparison and Contrast



| Feature | Cloud Broker (CB) | Cloud Auditor (CA) |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Primary Function\*\* | \*\*Operational/Managerial:\*\* Manages service delivery, enhances services, and negotiates relationships. | \*\*Supervisory/Verification:\*\* Conducts independent assessments and verifies conformance to standards, policies, and performance criteria. |

| \*\*Role in Service Lifecycle\*\* | Involved in the \*\*provision and consumption\*\* of cloud services, acting as a single point of access and potentially creating new aggregated services. | Involved in the \*\*evaluation and verification\*\* of services provided by the Cloud Provider in terms of security, performance, and privacy. |

| \*\*Focus of Activities\*\* | Service Intermediation, Service Aggregation, and Service Arbitrage. | Security Audit, Privacy-Impact Audit, and Performance Audit. |

| \*\*Relationship to Cloud Provider\*\* | Negotiates contracts and relationships, often requesting services from the provider on behalf of the consumer, potentially obscuring the provider from the consumer. | Conducts independent evaluations of the provider’s services, requiring interaction to collect necessary auditing information. |

| \*\*Goal\*\* | To simplify the consumer experience, provide value-added services, and manage diverse service integration. | To ensure reliability, conformance, security, and privacy, particularly important for governmental adoption and building trust in the cloud ecosystem. |



### Prompt 2:

What are the five major actors defined in NIST SP 800-292?



### Response



The Cloud Broker is like a \*\*general contractor\*\* who integrates various specialty services (Cloud Providers) to deliver a seamless, enhanced final product to the client (Cloud Consumer). Conversely, the Cloud Auditor is like a \*\*third-party inspector\*\* whose sole job is to check the quality, compliance, and structural integrity of the service against established blueprints (standards and SLAs).



The five major actors defined within the framework of the \*\*NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture\*\* are based on an Actor/Role model and are detailed in the sources (which primarily discuss NIST Special Publication 500-292, the Reference Architecture document).



These five major participating actors, or entities, each participate in a transaction or process and/or perform tasks in cloud computing:



\*   \*\*Cloud Consumer:\*\* This entity is a person or organization that maintains a business relationship with, and uses services from, Cloud Providers. The consumer is the end user that the service is designed to support.

\*   \*\*Cloud Provider:\*\* This is the person, organization, or entity responsible for making a service available to interested parties (the consumers). The provider manages the computing infrastructure and runs the cloud software.

\*   \*\*Cloud Broker:\*\* An entity that manages the use, performance, and delivery of cloud services, and negotiates relationships and contracts between Cloud Providers and Cloud Consumers. A consumer may request services through a broker instead of contacting a provider directly.

\*   \*\*Cloud Auditor:\*\* A party that conducts an independent examination or assessment of cloud services, information system operations, performance, and the security of the cloud implementation. The audit may involve interactions with both the Cloud Consumer and the Cloud Provider.

\*   \*\*Cloud Carrier:\*\* An intermediary that provides connectivity and transport of cloud services between Cloud Consumers and Cloud Providers. They provide access to consumers through network, telecommunication, and other access devices.
